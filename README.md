You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

Run `npm install`. You can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

Frontend

Vue.js

Run the server with `npm run server`. The server should run on `localhost` with default port `8080`.
